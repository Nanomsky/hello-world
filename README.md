Tutorial on how to use Github

I am interested in learning how to code. I am currently working towards becoming a data science expert. Whatever that means. Anyway, this is my first Github project. Hopefully, I can publish some of the interesting projects I've carried out as part of the journey towards becoming a machine learning practitoioner.
